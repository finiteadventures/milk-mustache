### Hello! My name is Sarah and this is the place where I share my cooking adventures, big, small and in between. I don't have a mustache, but I'm working on it.

{: .dropcap }
The background scoop? I was born in Dublin, Ireland, which is beautiful and green and just as rainy as you've heard. I have some major wanderlust - I've travelled all around Europe, America and little bit of Asia and have lived in Vancouver, Los Angeles and New York city. I'm currently found in a little apartment with a pet turtle and too many housemates in Brooklyn, New York. *Hit me up if you're in the area, and I'll take you to all the tasty places!*

When I'm not wandering the world or growing out my mustache, I'm [playing the ukulele](https://soundcloud.com/sarah-quigley-542895767), writing poems and music, illustrating tiny stories or making wep applications (that's my day job). I have too many interests, so I also love playing board games, practicing yoga, running and cycling. Really I just love all the things!
