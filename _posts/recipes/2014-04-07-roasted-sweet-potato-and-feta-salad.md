      title: Roasted Sweet Potatoes
      ingredients:
        - 1 medium sweet potato, cut into small cubes
        - 1/2 tsp thyme
        - 1 tsp olive oil
        - 2 tsp sunflower oil
        - Salt, to taste
    dressing:
      title: Dressing
      ingredients:
        - Juice of 1 lemon (~3 tbsp lemon juice)
        - 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
        - 1 tbsp honey
        - 1 tbsp whole-grain mustard
        - Salt and pepper, to taste
  method:
    - Preheat oven to 180C (350F). Toss sweet potatoes in olive and sunflower oils, and season with thyme and a little salt. Roast sweet potatoes at 180 for 20 - 30 minutes, until soft, and a lightly crisped and browned. Remove them from the oven, and allow them to cool.
    - While sweet potatoes roast, divide spinach, rocket, and lettuce between two bowls or plates. Top each bowl with half the cucumber, pepper and tomatoes. Prepare the dressing by whisking together lemon juice, oil, honey and mustard, then seasoning to taste.
    - When sweet potatoes are cool, divide them between the two bowls. Top each bowl with the crumbled feta and scallions. Drizzle half the dressing over each salad.
  variations:
    - Looking for something a little more filling? Top the salad with grilled chicken or add some nuts or seeds.
    - Substitute dried apricots with another type of dried fruit. Dried figs or dates could both be excellent.

Anyone who knows me well will be aware that I'm a salad fiend. They're my favourite lunch, and my go-to food when I want a lazy dinner. My earliest kitchen memories are of spending, what felt like hours, laying out vegetables that my mother had sliced... In complex fractal like patterns on top of giant bowls of mixed greens, I placed thin rings of  tomato, delicate strips of pepper and half-moons of cucumber.

As a kid returning from visits to family in New York, I would always miss the colourful salads served up in cafes and restaurants there. In Dublin, miserable bowls of iceberg lettuce, sliced white onion and cucumber dogged my path to salad heaven. Thankfully, the explosion of the Irish restaurant scene has made delicious salads abundant enough here to please even the most ardent salad lover, and I'm just left craving New York bagels and black and white cookies.

Today's recipe is a simple salad, made a little fancier (and more filling) by the addition of sweet potatoes roasted with a sprinkling of thyme. Feta cheese, dried apricots, cherry tomatoes make this salad the stuff of my food fantasies - and hopefully yours too.
