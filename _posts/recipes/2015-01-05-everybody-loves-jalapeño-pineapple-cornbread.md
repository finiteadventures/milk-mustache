It’s another Tuesday in our topsy turvy Brooklyn apartment and Mike asks me to make cornbread — or I should say more cornbread. Just the night before, we had polished off a batch, companion to a pot of use-up-the carrots-that-have-been-in-the-freezer-too-long lentil soup. Today, the scent lingers, haunting our kitchen (and thoughts) like a new romance.

It’s Tuesday and, for a second day running, I’m weighing dry ingredients, whisking wet. Not content to make quite the same bread twice, I dial it up a notch with jalapeño peppers, pineapple and a dash of paprika. In no time, I’m flour-streaked, chilli-fingered, spattered in batter — but the bread’s in the oven and it smells damn good.

It smells so good that it’s barely out the stove door before my housemates descend like bandits, bread and butter knives at the ready. With whisk and camera in hand, I fend them off for long enough to snap a few shots of the precious cornbread bullion.

Speckled green with jalapeños, top decorated with jalapeño rings and a perfect golden brown, this is one of prettiest cornbreads that I’ve ever prepared — and it tastes amazing too: spicy and just a little sweet. It’s tender-crusted, crumbly and moist — a veritable riot in the mouth (best riot of your life).

Oh cornbread, the only problem now is that you’re gone already — too quickly consumed by cornbread-loving hoards (and me). Time to bake another loaf.
