  title: Basic Stove-top Oatmeal 
  meta:
    preparation-time: 5 - 15 minutes
    cooking-time: 3 - 5 minutes
    yield: 1 - 3 portions 
  notes:
    - This is a very loose recipe, leaving lots of wiggle room for you to tailor it to your personal taste. I recommend using jumbo rolled oats, rather than the quick cooking kind, as I find their texture to be more satisfying. However, if you enjoy a very creamy texture, you may prefer the quick cooking oats. I like to use a mixture of nut milk and water when preparing my oatmeal. I usually use 1 cup nut milk and 1½ cups water for every cup of oats I prepare. My favourite milk of all is cashew milk, but almond milk or plain old dairy milk will work just as well.
    - I'm a small person, and a proportionally small eater. ⅓ of a cup of oats is usually an ample breakfast for me, but my larger more masculine roommates will often eat a cup of oats in a single sitting. This recipe can be equally well prepared in a microwave safe bowl in the microwave, with similar cooking time. Beware, use a large bowl (and perhaps a lower power setting such as 70 or 80%) as oatmeal has a tendency to boil over in the microwave. It's worth noting, that I tend to prefer the texture of oatmeal prepared on the stove top.
  ingredient-lists:
    main:
      ingredients:
        - 1 cup rolled oats
        - 2½ cups liquid (milk / nut milk, water or a mixture of both)
    mixins:
      title: Mixins
      ingredients:
        - 3 tbsp raisins
        - 3 tsp flax seeds
    toppings:
      title: Toppings
      ingredients:
        - Fresh fruit of your choosing, chopped or sliced as necessary
        - A spoonful of nut butter
        - A sprinkling of nuts and / or seeds (optional)
        - A spoonful of honey or jam (optional)
  method:
    - Into a medium pot, measure oats, water and / or milk. Add raisins and flax seeds.
    - Bring oatmeal to a gentle simmer. Cook until thick and creamy, stirring frequently to ensure oatmeal doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot.
    - Transfer oatmeal to serving bowl(s).
    - Top oatmeal with fresh fruit. Dollop on nut butter. If using, sprinkle on nuts and / or seeds, spoon on jam or drizzle on honey.
  variations:
    - Mix in other types of dried fruit, nuts or seeds before cooking. Dried apricots are particularly delicious.
    - Mix in some spices before cooking - or dust with spices after cooking. Cinnamon is a classic, but nutmeg, allspice, or cloves could all be interesting additions. Get creative.
    - Lemon curd, nutella, maple syrup, stewed fruit (or rhubarb)... there are as many topping options as you can imagine.

I was sitting in my local ramen shop, Shinobi noodles, digging into a bowl of tan tan men when I discovered that my friend Jesse doesn't eat breakfast. Jesse is an ace computer programmer by day, dance ninja by night, an all day cookie master and a completely wonderful person, so his abject negligence in the breakfast department was unexpected and somewhat disconcerting.

I hate to think of Jesse missing out on the first (and quite possibly the best) meal of the day, so I've set out on a grand quest to get Jesse to eat breakfast — and my quest begins with oatmeal. In case it wasn't obvious from the outpourings of photos, I really like oatmeal. I have a solid oatmeal habit, and though I'm will effusively deny it, something of an oatmeal obsession. Strike that, why deny my obsession? Oatmeal is so unequivocably awesome.

Some fairy tale characters understand the joys of a good bowl of oatmeal, though they don't always get the temperature just right. It's just so satisfying — and so easy to keep around the house... so versatile and so cheap. The true joy of oatmeal is not so much in the oatmeal itself (though that is wonderful), but in all the things you can put in your oatmeal and all the things you can put on top.
