recipe:
  title: Apricot and Almond Truffles
  meta:
    preparation-time: 5 - 15 minutes + refrigeration time
    yield: 8 - 10 pieces
  notes:
    - These truffles are delicious plain or coated in white chocolate. For vegans, omit the coating, or use a vegan white chocolate. To save on waste and make the process of coating the truffles as easy as possible, use a small deep container to melt the chocolate. These truffles are best stored in the refrigerator, and are at their best when served a little cold.
    - As an excellent counterpoint to these sweet fruity treats, consider preparing their [dark fudgy brethren](/recipes/date-nut-truffles/).

        - 80 g dried apricots
        - 2 tbsp ground almonds

    coating:
      title: To Coat in White Chocolate
      steps:
        - In a small double boiler, melt white chocolate.
        - Using a toothpick or skewer, roll each ball in the chocolate until it is thoroughly coated. Use a spoon to coat any hard to reach areas.

        - Refrigerate until the chocolate has hardened.

My cat Rumptious tells me I should pay him more attention. He pokes me in the ankle as I roll balls of apricots and almonds between my palms and dip them in vanilla bean speckled white chocolate - apricots in white coats, coats for winter. Cats don't appreciate apricots, or almonds, or white chocolate for that matter, or understand the merits coating one in the other.

Rumptious knows other joys, cat pleasures that I can't truly know - the thrill of stalking shadows in the night, of creeping between streetlights, the dark lust of the hunt. Still I feel a pang of regret for Rumptious, with his cat's tongue, blind to the subtle sweet joy of apricots... Because if there's a time for a taste of blushing summer sun, it's in these darkening Irish days at the close of autumn, when daylight disappears to a few short damp and dreary hours. If apricots in spring are sweet, then the apricots in November, as winter digs its heals in, are sweeter still.
