  title: Chocolate Chip Coconut Slices
  meta:
    preparation-time: 15 - 20 minutes
    cooking-time: 22 - 25 minutes
    yield: 12 - 16 slices
  notes:
    - Adapted from Samoas Bars on Averie Cooks.
    - This one bowl recipe is dense, chewy and a little fudgy - delicious enough to charm coconut lovers and sceptics alike.
    - If you find these slices a little greasy fresh from the oven, leave them to cool completely (or even to sit overnight) - this will allow oils from the coconut to be reabsorbed. If the slices are still too greasy, consider cutting the amount of butter down a smidge. I have not personally had this issue with the recipe I'm sharing below. I did find Averie's original recipe a little on the greasy side, even after sitting, and cut down the butter in my version with this in mind.
  ingredient-lists:
    main:
      ingredients:
        - 100 g (3.5 ounces) salted butter
        - 150 g (5.3 ounces / ¾ cup) light muscovado sugar (or similar light sticky brown sugar)
        - 50 g (1.8 ounces / ¼ cup) golden caster sugar (can be substituted with any natural sugar, or if necessary, white sugar)
        - 1 large egg
        - 2 tsp (10 ml) natural vanilla extract
        - 100 g (3.5 ounces / 1 cup) unsweetened shredded coconut
        - 100 - 125 g (3.5 - 4.4 ounces / ~¾ cup) all-purpose flour (flour varies greatly in density, measure by weight if possible) (start with 100g, if batter is not fairly thick add extra 25g)
        - 100 g (3.5 ounces / ~¾ cup) dark chocolate (70% cocoa content), chopped into chips (or ready made chocolate chips)
        - 75 g (2.6 ounces / ~½ cup) white chocolate chips
  method:
    - Preheat oven to 180ºC (350ºF). Line a 20 or 23 cm (8 or 9 inch) round pan with parchment paper (or aluminium foil), and butter the parchment.
    - In a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water, melt the butter. Remove the bowl from the heat and stir in both types of sugar. Allow the mixture to cool a little (about 5 minutes), then stir in egg, flour and coconut. Fold in chocolate chips.
    - Pour the mixture into the prepared baking pan, sprinkle a few extra chocolate chips on top if desired and bake for 22 - 25 minutes (until the top has turned a nice golden brown colour and the edges are beginning to darken.
    - Cool in the pan before slicing, or enjoy still a little warm and gooey from the oven.
  variations:
    - Make Samoas bars instead of slices. Use an 20 x 20 cm (8 x 8 inch) square pan, instead of a round pan.
    - "Try different mix-ins in place of (or in addition to) dark and white chocolate chips. Consider: milk chocolate, butterscotch or even yoghurt chips, dried fruit or nuts, or your favourite candy."

There are so many recipes that I try once, and then never again. It's not that there's anything wrong with most of them per se - it's just that once was enough to tick that experience box... been there done, done that, ate the canoli. On the other hand, some recipes are keepers, like these chocolate chip coconut slices. Huzzah!

A little like a cross between a blondie and a chewy chocolate chip cookie, these dense slices are definitely too good not to make again... and too easy! One bowl, 15 minutes of measuring and stirring (if even), less than a half an hour in the oven and - BAM - done! Let them cool - or don't - and dig in.

This recipe was adapted from Averie's Samoas Bars over at [Averie Cooks](http://averiecooks.com). Though I loved the original recipe, it was a little too sweet and greasy for my taste. With this in mind, in my version, I've toned down the sugar and butter a smidge from the original recipe - and I'm really happy with the results.

According to Averie, her recipes was inspired by a girl scout cookie known as 'Samoas' or alternatively, 'Caramel DeLites'. I was never a girl scout. I had never even tasted a girl scout cookie until my recent move to Canada (we don't really have girl scout cookies in Ireland). I'll say this - I didn't need the fuzzy haze of nastalgia to love this recipe - one bite was quite enough for that...

... But maybe I would have needed that fuzzy haze to keep the name 'Samoas'. Romantic as it is to imagine the baking of Samoan islanders inspiring dessert, I can't help suspecting their true origin is a little closer to home.

Romantic too are the wafting scents of butter, chocolate and coconut filling the kitchen as you sit back, hot coffee in hand waiting for your chocolate chip coconut slices to emerge from the oven.
