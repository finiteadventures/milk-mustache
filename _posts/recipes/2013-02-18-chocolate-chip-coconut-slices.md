  title: Chocolate Chip Coconut Slices
  meta:
    preparation-time: 15 - 20 minutes
    cooking-time: 22 - 25 minutes
    yield: 12 - 16 slices
  notes:
    - This one bowl recipe is dense, chewy and a little fudgy - delicious enough to charm coconut lovers and sceptics alike. If you find these slices a little greasy fresh from the oven, leave them to cool completely (or even to sit overnight) - this will allow oils from the coconut to be reabsorbed.
  ingredient-lists:
    main:
      ingredients:
        - 100 g (3.5 ounces) salted butter
        - 150 g (5.3 ounces / ¾ cup) light muscovado sugar (or similar light sticky brown sugar)
        - 50 g (1.8 ounces / ¼ cup) golden caster sugar (can be substituted with any natural sugar, or if necessary, white sugar)
        - 1 large egg
        - 2 tsp (10 ml) natural vanilla extract
        - 100 g (3.5 ounces / 1 cup) unsweetened shredded coconut
        - 100 - 125 g (3.5 - 4.4 ounces / ~¾ cup) all-purpose flour (flour varies greatly in density, measure by weight if possible) (start with 100g, if batter is not fairly thick add extra 25g)
        - 100 g (3.5 ounces / ~¾ cup) dark chocolate (70% cocoa content), chopped into chips
        - 75 g (2.6 ounces / ~½ cup) white chocolate, chopped into chips
  method:
    main:
      steps:
        - Preheat oven to 180ºC (350ºF). Line a 20 or 23 cm (8 or 9 inch) round pan with parchment paper (or aluminium foil), and butter the parchment.
        - In a double boiler, melt the butter. Remove from the heat and stir in both types of sugar.
        - After allowing the mixture to cool a little (about 5 minutes), stir in egg, flour and coconut. Fold in chocolate chips.
        - Pour mixture into the prepared baking pan, sprinkle a few extra chocolate chips on top if desired and bake for 22 - 25 minutes (until the top has turned a nice golden brown colour and the edges are beginning to darken.
        - Cool in the pan before slicing, or enjoy still a little warm and gooey from the oven.
  variations:
    - Make bars instead of slices. Use an 20 x 20 cm (8 x 8 inch) square pan, instead of a round pan.
    - "In place of (or in addition to) dark and white chocolate chips, try milk chocolate, butterscotch or even yoghurt chips, dried fruit or nuts, or your favourite candy."
