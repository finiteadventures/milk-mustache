  title: Chocolate Brownies 
  meta:
    preparation-time: 15-20 minutes
    cooking-time: 25-30 minutes
    yield: 16 5 x 5cm squares 
  notes:
    - It only takes a tiny bit of time and a few basic baking ingredients to create these simple, yet decadent brownies.
  ingredient-list:
    main:
      ingredients:
        - 100 g (3.5 ounces) dark chocolate (70% cocoa content), roughly chopped
        - 115 g (4 ounces / 1 stick) unsalted butter, plus a little extra for greasing pans
        - 200g (7 ounces / 1 cup) golden caster sugar (can be substituted with any natural sugar, or if necessary, white sugar)
        - 2 large eggs
        - 1 tsp (5 ml) natural vanilla extract
        - 110 g (4 ounces / 2/3 cup) all-purpose flour
        - 1/4 tsp salt
  method:
    - Pre-heat oven to 180 C (350 F). Line a 20 x 20 cm (8 x 8 inch) square baking pan with parchment paper (or aluminium foil), and butter the parchment. The paper should extend above 2 edges of the pan.
    - In a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water, melt butter and chocolate, stirring until smooth. Remove from bowl from the heat, and whisk in sugar until fully combined.
    - Whisk in eggs, one at a time, followed by vanilla extract and salt. Finally, using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, stir in flour.
    - Spread finished batter evenly in the prepared baking pan, and bake for 25 - 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into centre comes out clean (or almost clean - a few crumbs are okay, especially if you like your brownies fudgy).
    - Cool in the pan. Slice into 16 5 x 5 cm (2 x 2 inch) squares, or however you fancy. For a touch of class, dust with a little powdered sugar.
  variations:
    - Toss in chocolate chips or nuts. Swirl with caramel or your favourite nut butter. Spike with alcohol. Or find your inner kid and stud with your favourite candy! There's no end to the wonderful things you could do with these brownies.

Brownies - simple, comforting, ever satisfying - who can fail to love the baker and bearer of brownies? Here's a little secret those brownie bakers have been trying to hush up for years... brownies are incredibly simple to prepare (or at least they can be). The recipe I'm going to share with you here is one of the quickest and easiest I've come across - and also one of the best.

I should take a moment to thank Deb Perelman of Smitten Kitchen. Deb's recipe blog is truly inspiring, one of the best the internet has to offer... and it is from her favourite brownies that I have adapted this recipe. I'm extra grateful because these brownies have saved me time and time again in those 'emergencies' when I've promised baked goods, but failed at shopping/time management.

At times like that, this recipe makes me extra happy. Why? Seven ingredients, and for me at least, ingredients I almost always have around the house. Why? Twenty minutes, and they're in the oven, filling the kitchen with warm scents of home-baking. Yay! Another twenty minutes or so later, and boom - brownies... tasty tasty brownies and a satisfying sense of accomplishment.

Extra bonus, these brownies (like most brownies) are cooled in the pan, so they can travel with you, fresh from the oven. No need to resort to that (lame?) excuse, 'I was late because my _____________ had to cool before I glazed it'. I think I may have actually used that one at some point.

There's a decadence to the preparation of brownies that I love: cracking the chocolate, cutting the butter, watching them melt together until they meld in thick smooth chocolate glory... whisking and stirring and mixing and pouring. Mmmm.

I'm not ashamed to admit that I lick the wooden spoon - and the wire whisk - and sometimes even the last scrapings from the bottom of the mixing bowl. I eat the crumbs too - the crumbs that stick to the knife, and the baking paper... that are left on the cutting board after slicing the fudgey treats. I'm not ashamed one bit -  these are the little joys that life is made of.

Having now thoroughly confessed my sins, and more than adequately expressed the ardency of my love for (these) brownies, here, at last is the recipe.
