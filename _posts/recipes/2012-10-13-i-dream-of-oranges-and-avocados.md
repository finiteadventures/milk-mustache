  title: Couscous with Orange and Avocado
  meta:
    preparation-time: 10 - 15 minutes
    cooking-time: 5 - 10 minutes
    yield: 3 - 4 portions
  notes:
    - This simple dish is best served immediately after preparation. If you wish to make it in advance, I would advise omitting the cucumber and avocado, and adding them at the last minute, shortly before serving. To enjoy the avocado at its best, avoid cutting it until everything else is prepared.
  ingredient-lists:
    main:
      ingredients:
        - 1 cup couscous, cooked with a little salt
        - 1 cup cooked red kidney beans, rinsed
        - 2 medium oranges, segmented and cut into chunks
        - "¼ - ⅓ English cucumber, sliced into half-circles"
        - 1 avocado, cut into chunks
        - Handful of parsley, finely chopped (about ¼ cup) (optional)
        - Salt and pepper, to taste
    dressing:
      title: Dressing
      ingredients:
          - ¼ cup freshly squeezed orange juice (juice of 1 medium orange)
          - 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
          - 1 tbsp white wine vinegar
          - "~ 1 heaped tbsp honey"
          - "¼ tsp orange zest (zest of ~ ¼ medium orange) (optional)"
  method:
    - Prepare couscous and set aside until all water has been absorbed.
    - Whisk dressing ingredients together in small jar.
    - Prepare beans, orange, cucumber, avocado and parsley and place in a large salad bowl. Add dressing and lightly toss.
    - Add couscous to the salad (it doesn't matter if the couscous is still a little warm) and season to taste. Toss until thoroughly mixed.
    - Dig in and enjoy!

Let's talk about orange and avocado - two foods just begging to be served together, and yet before I accidentally created this dish from the dregs of my larder, I never knew it. Orange's sweet tanginess is the perfect counterpoint for the creaminess of avocado. I've fallen in love with this pairing, and have been spending my spare moments unashamedly daydreaming about it.

This dish is light, fresh - crunchy, zesty (shouldn't more things be zesty?) - and easy on the wallet. It's perfect for a simple wholesome lunch, a palette cleansing side -- or even, for the adventurous, an unusual and exotic breakfast. Speaking of breakfast...
