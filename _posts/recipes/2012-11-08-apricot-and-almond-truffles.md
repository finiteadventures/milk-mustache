  title: Apricot and Almond Truffles
  meta:
    preparation-time: 5 - 15 minutes + refrigeration time
    yield: 8 - 10 pieces
  notes:
    - These truffles are delicious plain or coated in white chocolate. For vegans, omit the coating, or use a vegan white chocolate. To save on waste and make the process of coating the truffles as easy as possible, use a small deep container to melt the chocolate. These truffles are best stored in the refrigerator, and are at their best when served a little cold.

    main:
      ingredients:
        - 80 g dried apricots
        - 2 tbsp ground almonds

        - 2 tbsp rolled oats
        - 1 tsp almond essence
        - Pinch of salt
    coating:
      title: White Chocolate Coating (Optional)

  method:
    main:
      steps:
        - Blend apricots, both types of almonds, oats, almond essense and salt in a food processor until they form a ball with the consistency of a thick dough.
        - Roll the mixture into small balls and refrigerate them until firm.
    coating:
      title: To Coat in White Chocolate
      steps:
        - In a small double boiler, melt white chocolate.
        - Using a toothpick or skewer, roll each ball in the chocolate until it is thoroughly coated. Use a spoon to coat any hard to reach areas.
        - Place each truffle on a parchment paper covered plate or sheet pan, and garnish with a flaked almond or dried apricot piece.
        - Refrigerate until the chocolate has hardened.

My cat Rumptious tells me I should pay him more attention. He pokes me in the ankle as I roll balls of apricot and almond between my palms and dip them in vanilla bean speckled white chocolate. Cats don't appreciate apricot, almond or white chocolate, or understand the merits coating one in the other.

Subtly sweet, bright and fruity, these apricot and almond truffles make a fine counterpoint to their [dark fudgy date nut truffle brethren](/recipes/date-nut-truffles/). Just

These apricot and almond truffles are soft bursts of fruitiness, bright orange parties for your tongue. Subtly sweet, smooth with a hint of nutty crunch, they are great to have on hand when you need a quick energy boost, or to tame a raging sweet tooth. I like them in combination with their fudgy inspirations, date nut truffles.

These truffles are delicious plain, but for something a little more decadent, coat them in white chocolate. I found some awesome vanilla bean speckled white chocolate for mine and couldn't have been happier with the contrast between the soft fruity truffles and their crunchy rich outer shell.

When I created these truffles, another inspiration was marzipan. Their flavour and texture is reminiscent of that sweet almond paste, but they are less cloyingly sweet - and definitely a healthier everyday treat than their sugary inspiration. Marzipan seems to be one of those foods that's either loved or hated, but I'm hoping these truffles will still appeal to the marzipan antagonists of the world. If you're a marzipan hater, give them a go and tell me your thoughts.

Well, until next time - happy truffle eating!
