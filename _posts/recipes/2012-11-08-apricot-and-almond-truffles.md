  title: Apricot and Almond Truffles 
  meta:
    preparation-time: 5 - 15 minutes + refrigeration time
    yield: 8 - 10 pieces
  notes:
    - These apricot and almond truffles are a subtly sweet fruity counterpart to my date nut truffles. These truffles are delicious plain or coated in white chocolate.
    - For vegans, omit the coating, or use a vegan white chocolate. Without the white chocolate coating, these truffles are suitable for raw food lovers.
  ingredient-lists:
    main:
      ingredients:
        - 80 g dried apricots
        - 2 tbsp ground almonds
        - 2 tbsp flaked almonds
        - 2 tbsp rolled oats
        - 1 tsp almond essence
        - Pinch of salt
    coating:
      title: Coating (Optional)
      ingredients:
        - Good quality white chocolate (~50 g per 5 truffles)
        - A few flaked almonds and/or couple of dried apricots, chopped in small pieces (garnish)
  method:
    - Blend all the ingredients (except coating) in a food processor until they form a ball of thick dough. Roll the dough into small balls. Enjoy the truffles nude, or coat in white chocolate.
    - "To coat with white chocolate: In a small bowl, over a pot of boiling water, melt some white chocolate. Using a toothpick or skewer, dip each ball in the chocolate until it is thoroughly coated. (This is easiest with truffle balls that have been refrigerated). Use a spoon to coat any hard to reach areas. Place each truffle on a parchment paper covered plate or sheet pan, and garnish with a flaked almond or dried apricot piece. Refrigerate until the chocolate has hardened."
    - These truffles are best stored in the refrigerator, and are at their best when served a little cold.

These apricot and almond truffles are soft bursts of fruitiness, bright orange parties for your tongue. Subtly sweet, smooth with a hint of nutty crunch, they are great to have on hand when you need a quick energy boost, or to tame a raging sweet tooth. I like them in combination with their fudgy inspirations, date nut truffles.

These truffles are delicious plain, but for something a little more decadent, coat them in white chocolate. I found some awesome vanilla bean speckled white chocolate for mine and couldn't have been happier with the contrast between the soft fruity truffles and their crunchy rich outer shell.

When I created these truffles, another inspiration was marzipan. Their flavour and texture is reminiscent of that sweet almond paste, but they are less cloyingly sweet - and definitely a healthier everyday treat than their sugary inspiration. Marzipan seems to be one of those foods that's either loved or hated, but I'm hoping these truffles will still appeal to the marzipan antagonists of the world. If you're a marzipan hater, give them a go and tell me your thoughts.

As for tips and tricks, there's not much to know about these truffles. I would like to reiterate one thing I said about creating my date nut truffles: if chocolate coating your truffles, melt the chocolate in a small deep container (I used a ramekin suspended over boiling water in a steamer basket). This saves on chocolate waste, so you only need to melt just the right amount of chocolate for your truffles - not to mention creating a deeper well of chocolate for easier truffle coating. I was able to coat about two thirds of the surface of my truffles simply by dipping the truffles in the melted chocolate, but I had to use a small spoon to dollop the chocolate on the final third.

Well, until next time - happy truffle eating!
