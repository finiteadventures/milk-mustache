  title: "Rainbow Salad with Bulgur Wheat and Beans"
  meta:
    preparation-time: 20 minutes
    cooking-time: 15 minutes
    yield: 4 - 6 portions
  notes:
    - I call this simple wholesome salad "Rainbow Salad", because it has ingredients of (almost) all the colours in the rainbow. It makes a great lunch, snack or side salad, and keeps well for several days in the fridge.
    - This is one of those recipes that started out as a "What can I make from what's left in the kitchen?" kind of creation, but has evolved into one of my go-to dishes when I'm looking for a simple healthy meal. It's quick to prepare and keeps well in the fridge, which makes it perfect for lunches or snacks. I love having a grain based salad, like this one, ready and waiting in the fridge. It's perfect for when I need a quick pick-me-up or a no-fuss, healthy meal.
  ingredient-lists:
    main:
      ingredients:
        - 1 cup (200 g) bulgur wheat
        - 1 400 g can (240 g drained - about 1⅓ cups) red kidney beans
        - 2 medium carrots, sliced in half circles
        - 125 - 150 g (~ 1 cup) green beans, sliced in thirds
        - 200 - 250 g (1½ - 2 cups) cherry tomatoes , halved - or 3 medium tomatoes, roughly chopped
        - ½ medium red onion (~ ½ cup), finely chopped
        - ¼ cup (40 - 50 g) raisins or sultanas
        - 2 tbsp (20 g) pine nuts
        - ¼ cup fresh coriander leaf, roughly chopped (optional)
        - Lemon slices (optional garnish)
    dressing:
      title: Dressing
      ingredients:
        - 1 heaped tbsp wholegrain mustard
        - 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
        - 3 tbsp cider or white wine vinegar
        - ½ tsp salt
        - A generous grinding of pepper
  method:
    main:
      steps:
        - Steam the green beans and carrots, taking care not to overcook them. Rinse them in cold water to ensure they do not cook further in the residual heat and set aside.
        - Cook the bulgur in 1½ cups boiling water over a low heat. When all the water has been absorbed, set it aside.
        - Using a colander, drain and thoroughly rinse the red kidney beans.
        - Prepare the onions, tomatoes and coriander and place them in a large salad bowl with the raisins, pine nuts and red kidney beans.
        - Whisk the dressing ingredients together in small jar.
        - Add the dressing to the salad bowl and toss it with the other ingredients until they are completely coated.
        - Finally, add the steamed vegetables and bulgur, and gently toss the salad once more, until all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Do not worry if the carrots and bulgur are still warm at this point; this salad is great either warm, room temperature or cold.
  variations:
    - Use couscous in place of the bulgur. Other grains might be nice too... What about quinoa, brown rice, or even orzo? Feel free to experiment and tell me about the results!
    - Replace the red kidney beans with another bean of your choice. I recommend chickpeas. Fried or grilled cubes of tofu might also be a delicious alternative.
    - Add some feta or mozzarella cheese. This can be added as an extra on top of all the normal ingredients, or in place of the kidney beans, if you're not a bean lover.
    - "Try any or all of the following: Replace the green beans with lightly steamed broccoli. Substitute steamed sweet potatoes or butternut squash for the carrots. Use 2 - 3 scallions in place of the red onion."
    - Replace the pine nuts with another nut or seed of your choice. I recommend pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds or sliced almonds.

As its name suggests, this salad is packed full of a veritable rainbow of ingredients: nutritious beans, sweet carrots, refreshing tomatoes, tangy onions, crunchy pine nuts and raisins (extra sweetness) - and of course, bulgur wheat. Over the last while, I've developed something of a small obsession with bulgur - I love its chunky grains, so hearty and nutty flavour. I love how all the subtle flavours of this salad are tied together by the bulgur, and I hope that you do too.

I thought it was worth mentioning, for anyone on a tight budget, this is a happily cheap dish to prepare, especially if you replace the pine nuts (which are quite overpriced in my local supermarket) with a more affordable seed or nut, use normal tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes and omit the fresh coriander (or grow your own). I always try to be conscious of how much I'm spending on food - it's comforting to have some staple recipes that are both wholesome and easy on the pocket.
