  title: "Rainbow Salad with Bulgur Wheat and Beans"
  meta:
    preparation-time: 20 minutes
    cooking-time: 15 minutes
    yield: 4 - 6 portions
  notes:
    - I call this simple wholesome salad "Rainbow Salad", because it has ingredients of (almost) all the colours in the rainbow. It makes a great lunch, snack or side salad, and keeps well for several days in the fridge.
  ingredient-lists:
    main:
      ingredients:
        - 1 cup (200 g) bulgur wheat
        - 1 400 g can (240 g drained - about 1⅓ cups) red kidney beans
        - 2 medium carrots, sliced in half circles
        - 125 - 150 g (~ 1 cup) green beans, sliced in thirds
        - 200 - 250 g (1½ - 2 cups) cherry tomatoes , halved - or 3 medium tomatoes, roughly chopped
        - ½ medium red onion (~ ½ cup), finely chopped
        - ¼ cup (40 - 50 g) raisins or sultanas
        - 2 tbsp (20 g) pine nuts
        - ¼ cup fresh coriander leaf, roughly chopped (optional)
        - Lemon slices (optional garnish)
    dressing:
      title: Dressing
      ingredients:
        - 1 heaped tbsp wholegrain mustard
        - 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
        - 3 tbsp cider or white wine vinegar
        - ½ tsp salt
        - A generous grinding of pepper
  method:
    main:
      steps:
        - Steam green beans and carrots, taking care not to overcook them. Once tender, rinse in cold water to ensure they do not cook further and set aside.
        - Cook the bulgur in 1½ cups boiling water over a low heat. When all the water has been absorbed, set it aside.
        - In a colander, drain and thoroughly rinse red kidney beans.
        - Prepare onions, tomatoes and coriander and place in a large salad bowl with raisins, pine nuts and red kidney beans.
        - Whisk dressing ingredients in small jar.
        - Add dressing to salad bowl and toss all ingredients are completely coated.
        - Finally, add steamed vegetables and bulgur, and gently toss again until thoroughly mixed. Don't worry if carrots, green beans and bulgur are still warm; this salad is great either warm, room temperature or cold.
  variations:
    - Use couscous in place of the bulgur. Experiment with other grains, for example quinoa, brown rice, or orzo.
    - Replace red kidney beans with a bean of your choice. I recommend chickpeas. Fried or grilled cubes of tofu would also be a delicious alternative.
    - Add feta or mozzarella cheese in place of or in addition to the beans.
    - "Try any or all of the following: Replace green beans with lightly steamed broccoli. Substitute carrots with steamed sweet potatoes or butternut squash. Use 2 - 3 scallions in place of red onion."
    - Replace pine nuts with a nut or seed of your choice. I recommend pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds or sliced almonds.
