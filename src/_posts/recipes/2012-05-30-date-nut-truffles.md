recipe:
  title: Date Nut Truffles
  meta:
    preparation-time: 5 - 15 minutes + refrigeration time
    yield: 10 - 14 truffles
  notes:
    - Perfect post-exercise snacks, the fudgy texture and rich flavour of these wholesome truffles will please dessert-lovers and healthy eaters alike. Unlike their traditional alternatives, these truffles are suitable for vegans and raw foodies of the world.
    - These truffles are equally delicious plain or covered in one of coatings described below. For the best truffles, use the softest dates available. I recommend the Medjool variety.
  ingredient-lists:
    main:
      ingredients:
        - 120 g Medjool dates, pits removed (¾ cup, about 7 large dates)
        - ½ cup walnuts (~65 g)
        - 2 tbsp cocoa powder (or raw cocoa powder)
        - 2 tbsp dessicated coconut
        - ½ tsp natural vanilla essence
        - Pinch of salt
    coating:
      title: Coatings (Optional)
      ingredients:
        - Chopped nuts of choice (~2 tbsp per 5 truffles)
        - Cocoa powder (or raw cacao powder) (~1 tbsp per 5 truffles)
        - Good quality dark chocolate, minimum 60% cocoa content (25 - 50 g per 5 truffles)
        - Chopped walnuts (garnish)
  method:
    main:
      steps:
        - Blend all the ingredients (except coatings) in a food processor until they form a ball of thick dough.
        - Roll the dough into small balls.
        - Enjoy the truffles plain, or for some fancier options, try out one or more of the coatings described in detail below.
        - These truffles are best stored in the refrigerator, and are at their most fudgy and delicious when served a little cold.
    coating-1-chopped-nuts:
      title: "Coating 1: Chopped nuts"
      steps:
        - Roll each ball in chopped nuts until thoroughly coated. Brush off any loose nuts. This is easiest when the truffle balls are a just little soft and warm.
    coating-2-cocoa-powder:
      title: "Coating 2: Cocoa Powder"
      steps:
        - Lightly roll truffles in cocoa powder until thoroughly coated. This works well with either warm or refrigerated truffle balls.
    coating-3-dark-chocolate:
      title: "Coating 3: Dark Chocolate with Walnut Garnish"
      steps:
        - In a small bowl, over a pot of boiling water, melt some dark chocolate.
        - Using a toothpick or skewer, dip each ball in the chocolate until it is thoroughly coated. (This is easiest with truffle balls that have been refrigerated). Use a spoon to coat any hard to reach areas.
        - Place each truffle on a greaseproof paper covered plate or sheet pan, and garnish with a piece of chopped walnut.
        - Refrigerate until the chocolate has hardened.
  variations:
    - Use another nut of your choice in place of walnuts in the truffle mixture. Pecans or hazelnuts sound like tempting alternatives to me.
    - Stir some dark chocolate chips into to the truffle mixture for greater decadence.
    - Consider alternative flavourings to vanilla essence, such as rum, peppermint extract or orange zest.
    - Think up your own truffle coatings! Try rolling the truffles in dessicated coconut. If you are not a dark chocolate lover, dip the truffles in white or milk chocolate instead.
    - Experiment with different garnishes for the chocolate-coated truffles. I think a dried cherry would look beautiful.

Date nut truffles, fudgy, flavourful, and oh so good for you... These truffles have some impressive stats: vegan, raw if you buy the ingredients with care, sweetened with dates, full of healthy nut oils... and yes, delicious. When I tasted these guys for the first time, I knew I'd finally found the treat I'd been waiting for. Date nut truffles, where have you been all my life? This is love.

You know what I find most exciting about this recipe? It has four variations: nude (I like this word), cocoa-dusted, nut-covered and, the piece-de-resistance, dark chocolated-coated. All four are delectable, and quick and easy to prepare. I'll admit, making the chocolate-coated variety takes a little longer (still quick!), and is a little messier, but they're so pretty that they are more than worth the extra trouble.

This recipe was adapted from a recipe on one of the most creative food blogs I follow. Do check out the original recipe, Chocolate-Covered Katie's fabulous German Chocolate Fudge Bites. Katie's blog is well worth exploring - it is full of tasty healthy treats! Her recipe is almost identical to the nude version of these truffles (I used walnuts in favour of pecans). My one nitty-picky problem wth the original recipe was I didn't think the sweets looked quite as delicious as they tasted... I wanted treats pretty enough for a chocolate box, and so I was inspired to create my variations of the recipe.

Of all these truffles' ingredients, the dates are the most important: seek out the softest dates you can find. Expensive as they can be, I recommend splashing out on some Medjool dates. (I remember my first time tasting Medjool dates as a nine or ten year old. I had a mini celebration at the discovery of sweets I wouldn't need my parent's permission to eat!) Medjool dates have a gorgeous, almost caramel-like, flavour and a melt-in-your-mouth texture, and are certainly the best dates that are commonly available in my local stores.

I tried cheap dried pitted dates in a previous attempt at this recipe. Due to their hardness and dryness, these dates did not process properly, leaving my truffles with a gritty texture and an uneven flavour. However, if all you can find are dried dates, you should achieve satisfactory results by soaking the dates beforehand in some water until they regain a soft texture. If your dates are soft, but not quite as moist as Medjool dates, try adding a tablespoon or two of water to the mixture before it is processed.

For the chocolate-coated variation of these truffles, good chocolate is also vital. I recommend dark chocolate with a minimum 60% cocoa content (I used 74%), preferably a good European brand (not Cadbury's). A small tip chocolate-coating the truffles: melt the chocolate in a small deep container (I used a ramekin placed in a steamer basket over some boiling water). I was able to coat about two thirds of the surface of my truffles simply by dipping the truffles in the melted chocolate, but I had to use a small spoon to dollop the chocolate on the final third.

I'm really excited about exploring more flavours of truffles (healthy or otherwise). The keen-eyed among you may have already spotted my next truffle concoction. Hint: look carefully in the photos posted here. The bright orange oddity hiding among its chocolate compadrees will soon be unveiled in all its apricot and almond glory. I have said too much already... You'll have to wait for the recipe to find out more.

Is it just me, or can you see these guys tucked away together in dainty gift boxes? "Oh wow, you made these!?" Yes, friends will be totally impressed when they see them... and even more once they've tasted them and you tell them how healthy they are!
