  title: Date Nut Truffles
  meta:
    preparation-time: 5 - 15 minutes + refrigeration time
    yield: 10 - 14 truffles
  notes:
    - Perfect post-exercise snacks, the fudgy texture and rich flavour of these wholesome truffles will please dessert-lovers and healthy eaters alike.
    - These truffles are equally delicious plain or covered in one of coatings described below. For the best truffles, use the softest dates available. I recommend the Medjool variety.
  ingredient-lists:
    main:
      ingredients:
        - 120 g Medjool dates, pits removed (¾ cup, about 7 large dates)
        - ½ cup walnuts (~65 g)
        - 2 tbsp cocoa powder (or raw cocoa powder)
        - 2 tbsp dessicated coconut
        - ½ tsp natural vanilla essence
        - Pinch of salt
    coating:
      title: Coatings (Optional)
      ingredients:
        - Chopped nuts of choice (~2 tbsp per 5 truffles)
        - Cocoa powder (or raw cacao powder) (~1 tbsp per 5 truffles)
        - Good quality dark chocolate, minimum 60% cocoa content (25 - 50 g per 5 truffles)
        - Chopped walnuts (garnish)
  method:
    main:
      steps:
        - Blend all the ingredients (except coatings) in a food processor until they form a ball of thick dough.
        - Roll the dough into small balls.
        - Enjoy the truffles plain, or for some fancier options, try out one or more of the coatings described in detail below.
        - These truffles are best stored in the refrigerator, and are at their most fudgy and delicious when served a little cold.

      title: "Coating 1: Chopped nuts"
      steps:
        - Roll each ball in chopped nuts until thoroughly coated. Brush off any loose nuts. This is easiest when the truffle balls are a just little soft and warm.
    coating-2-cocoa-powder:
      title: "Coating 2: Cocoa Powder"
      steps:
        - Lightly roll truffles in cocoa powder until thoroughly coated. This works well with either warm or refrigerated truffle balls.
    coating-3-dark-chocolate:
      title: "Coating 3: Dark Chocolate with Walnut Garnish"
      steps:
        - In a small bowl, over a pot of boiling water, melt some dark chocolate.
        - Using a toothpick or skewer, dip each ball in the chocolate until it is thoroughly coated. (This is easiest with truffle balls that have been refrigerated). Use a spoon to coat any hard to reach areas.
        - Place each truffle on a greaseproof paper covered plate or sheet pan, and garnish with a piece of chopped walnut.
        - Refrigerate until the chocolate has hardened.
  variations:
    - Use another nut of your choice in place of walnuts in the truffle mixture. Pecans or hazelnuts sound like tempting alternatives to me.
    - Stir some dark chocolate chips into to the truffle mixture for greater decadence.
    - Consider alternative flavourings to vanilla essence, such as rum, peppermint extract or orange zest.
    - Think up your own truffle coatings! Try rolling the truffles in dessicated coconut. If you are not a dark chocolate lover, dip the truffles in white or milk chocolate instead.
    - Experiment with different garnishes for the chocolate-coated truffles. I think a dried cherry would look beautiful.
