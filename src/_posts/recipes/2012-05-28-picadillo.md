  title: Picadillo
  meta:
    preparation-time: 10 minutes
    cooking-time: 40 minutes
    yield: 4 - 6 portions
  notes:
    - "Adapted from Better Home and Gardens: Mexican Cook Book, published in 1977."
    - Picadillo is a Latin American meat dish. This version is a subtly sweet variation with nuts, apples and raisins. It's excellent as a tortilla or taco filling or served over plain or flavoured rice. I like to accompany it with a combination of toppings such as chopped tomatoes, grated cheese, spinach, lettuce, home-made guacamole, chopped red onion, hot sauce, yoghurt or sour cream.
  ingredient-lists:
    main:
      ingredients:
        - 1 pound (450 g) lean minced beef or pork
        - 1 medium onion, finely chopped
        - 2 - 3 cloves garlic
        - 500 g (18 oz) passata (tomato puree)
        - 1 medium apple, peeled, cored and chopped
        - ½ cup raisins
        - ¼ cup slivered almonds
        - ¼ cup chopped parsley (optional)
        - 1 tbsp vinegar
        - 1 tsp sugar
        - 1 tsp salt
        - ¼ tsp ground cinnamon
        - ¼ tsp ground cumin
        - ⅛ tsp ground pepper
        - Olive oil
  method:
    main:
      steps:
        - In a medium-sized pot over a medium heat, fry the onions and garlic in a little olive oil. When the onions begin to turn translucent, add the beef and cook until brown. At this stage, if necessary, pour away any excess fat. Stir in all the remaining ingredients. Cover the pot, and simmer for 30 minutes.
        - Serve over rice, or as a tortilla or taco filling.
  variations:
    - For a delicious vegetarian (and vegan) version of this dish, simply replace the meat with 1 pound of cooked red kidney beans (or another bean of your choice).

Picadillo, a sweet fragrant Latin American stew of meat and tomatoes, was a household favourite when we were kids. On picadillo nights, the pot simmered for hours, leaving our home smelling of cinnamon, cumin and garlic. We were quaking with anticipation by dinner time, and stealing spoonfuls whenever we thought it would go unnoticed.

The steaming picadillo pot took pride of place, surrounded by dishes of flavoured rice, spicy chicken, or refried beans speckled with sauteed red peppers and onions. Almost every other possible nook and cranny of our dining table was covered by the vast array of toppings and side dishes: guacamole, spinach, chopped tomatoes, pungent grated Irish cheddar and so much more. 

Hot flour tortillas emerged from the oven and we'd all dig in, piling so many things on our tortillas that they would burst at the seams when we tried to eat them, leaving our fingers sticky. The mess was part of the fun.

This is that childhood picadillo recipe, adapted from my mom's 1977 *Better Homes and Garden* Mexican cookbook. Though it's a little rough around the edges now, stained from love and many cooking adventures, she still uses that cookbook and cooks picadillo - and now I cook it too.
