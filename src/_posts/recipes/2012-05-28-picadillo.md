  meta:
    preparation-time: 10 minutes
    cooking-time: 40 minutes
    yield: 4 - 6 portions
  notes:
    - "Adapted from Better Home and Gardens: Mexican Cook Book, published in 1977."
    - Picadillo is a Latin American meat dish. This version is a subtly sweet Mexican variation with nuts, apples and raisins. It's excellent as a tortilla or taco filling or served over plain or flavourted rice. I like to accompany it with a combination of toppings such as chopped tomatoes, grated cheese, spinach, lettuce, home-made guacamole, chopped red onion, hot sauce, yoghurt or sour cream.
  ingredient-lists:
    main:
      ingredients:
        - 1 pound (450 g) lean minced beef or pork
        - 1 medium onion, finely chopped
        - 2 - 3 cloves garlic
        - 500 g (18 oz) passata (tomato puree)
        - 1 medium apple, peeled, cored and chopped
        - ½ cup raisins
        - ¼ cup slivered almonds
        - ¼ cup chopped parsley (optional)
        - 1 tbsp vinegar
        - 1 tsp sugar
        - 1 tsp salt
        - ¼ tsp ground cinnamon
        - ¼ tsp ground cumin
        - ⅛ tsp ground pepper
        - Olive oil
  method:
    main:
      steps:
        - In a medium-sized pot over a medium heat, fry the onions and garlic in a little olive oil. When the onions begin to turn translucent, add the beef and cook until brown. At this stage, if necessary, pour away any excess fat. Stir in all the remaining ingredients. Cover the pot, and simmer for 30 minutes.
        - Serve over rice, or as a tortilla or taco filling.
  variations:
    - For a delicious vegetarian (and vegan) version of this dish, simply replace the meat with 1 pound of cooked red kidney beans (or another bean of your choice).
