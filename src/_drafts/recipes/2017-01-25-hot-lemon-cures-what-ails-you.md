  title: Hot Lemon Drink, for One
  meta:
    preparation-time: 5 minutes
    yield: 1 drink 
  notes:
    - This is basically a hot toddy on crack. (The secret ingredient is the cloves. They really take this to the next level.)
    - I like to play it pretty fast and loose with this drink, following instinct and adding a little of this and that until it tastes right. I recommend you do the same, but here are some measures to set you on the right track.
    - "Don't feel like measuring? My general guideline is 'More lemon and honey than you think, and plenty of cloves!'"
    - For more servings, multiply it up and mix in a pitcher or jug - or prepare individual portions separately as described below. 
  ingredient-lists:
    main:
      ingredients:
        - 3 - 4 tbsp (45 - 60 ml) lemon juice (juice of ~ 1 lemon)
        - 1 - 2 tbsp honey
        - 1/2 cup (125 ml) boiling water, or more to taste
        - 2 - 3 tbsp (30 - 45 ml) whiskey (optional, but advised and delicious)
        - Generous sprinkling of whole cloves
  method:
    main:
      steps:
        - Using boiling water, pre-warm a glass, tumbler or mug, then discard the water.
        - Mix lemon juice, honey, water and whiskey (if using) in the pre-warmed cup. (Begin with smaller volumes of each, and then adjust to taste.)
        - Add cloves and serve.

They can't all be until death. Time changes us, distance separates us. Even those relationships that endure those strains and batterings ebb and flow as we navigate the practical concerns of remaining alive. And then we die anyway.

Do you ever think of the legacies left by those lost or far away acquaintances, friends and lovers - not just the ways they changed and shaped you, but the little seemingly insignificant traces they left behind?

Nancy left me with a new found appreciation for lavender, citronella and starched sheets, and a taste of how to keep a sense of humour in the face of aching joints and encroaching age. Cian transformed my commutes with cycling, which if you know me is more significant than it sounds. Mike took me deep into the beautiful abyss of abstract computer programming - and together we learned how caring deeply someone can sometimes mean letting them go...

And though he doesn't know it, another Cian, Cian O'hEigeartaigh, the father of my first deep love, left me hot lemon drinks, his cure all - and now mine. And now I gift this drink to you, to cure what ails you.

(The whiskey wasn't in his original recipe, but I like to think it was implied.)
