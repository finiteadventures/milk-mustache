The centre piece of Faiyam and Dmitry's living room was a handmade wooden table best known as Beyonce, so known because her voluptuous curves rivalled those of her namesake. We sat around her Japanese style on cushions crocheted by Dmitry's grandmother, eating Spanish omelette and pesto.

At somewhere over 6 feet, Dmitry is quietly giant, admirable in delibareteness and (apparent) serenity. Faiyam is a much shorter ball of effusive and infectious enthusiasm.
